I have a Master Degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from Maastricht University. During my PhD (2012-2016; [link to my thesis](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/how-neuronal-oscillations-code-for-temporal-statistics)) I have studied how rhythm and temporal information is used to optimize perception. I used primarily EEG, but also MEG and EcoG. I found that on the one hand we use temporal structure to optimally predict when something is going to happen. The brain pro-actively uses this temporal structure to adapt processing. However, temporal information also provides information about the exact content of information, that is temporal information does not only provide cues for when, but also for what.

During my PostDoc (2016-2019) I have dived deeper into fundamental principles of storing information that might have a temporal context. How can the brain track continuously incoming information but use the same temporal dimension to code information?

Currently, I am working as a PostDoc in the [Language and Computation in Neural Systems group](https://lacns.github.io/) headed by Andrea Martin. I will focus my research on the integration of temporal information in a language context. Speaking requires the continuous integration of information as a speech stream evolves. However, temporal cues in speech provide in parallel a rich source of content information. How does the brain exploit this temporal structure to optimally process this type of signal?
