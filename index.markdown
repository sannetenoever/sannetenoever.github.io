## Temporal dynamics inside and outside the brain

Rhythm and temporal information is used to optimize perception. We use temporal structure to optimally predict when something is going to happen. The brain pro-actively uses this temporal structure to adapt processing. However, temporal information also provides information about the exact content of information, that is temporal information does not only provide cues for when, but also for what. For both operations (tracking and coding temporal information) it seems that the same temporal brain dynamics are important, namely brain oscillations.

How can the brain track continuously incoming information but use at the same time the same temporal dimension to code information? To do this the brain needs to compute in time as well as  with time.

For my research I used primarily EEG, but also MEG, EcoG, brain stimulation, and more recently computational modeling.

## Research lines

The relevance of temporal information and temporal coding is important for many cognitive domains. I can divide my research in the following research lines
### [Temporal tracking versus temporal coding](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/tracking-versus-coding.html)

### [Speech and language](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/speech-and-language.html)

### [Temporal coding for memory](/main/research/lines/2022/01/24/coding-for-memory.html)
